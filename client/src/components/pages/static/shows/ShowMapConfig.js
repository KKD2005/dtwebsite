I’m envisioning impressive athletic movements (jazz-style kicks & leaps) mixed in with sharp, intricate movements. The dancers will dance in groups to the different phrases in the song, sometimes layering multiple groups to the multiple layers of the music.  I’m looking for mostly jazz or contemp trained dancers, but I think it would be interesting to have a few good tutters/waackers to represent the fast layers of the music. I’m thinking bright neon colors for costumes and lighting, and maybe having some moments with UV light and fluorescent body paint.',

The movement will vary from sharp and controlled to movements of collapse as dancers lose their composure. Dancers will never make eye contact even when dancing together.

This could be because of something like depression, an abusive relationship, etc represented by one of the sets of people (if you watch the video of the song youll see). Then there might be a spoken word section as a transition in which you get the resolve and strength to overcome whatever is haunting you. And in cane shuga, the mood is more of a fight: you are angry and desperately want to rid yorself of whatever was causing the pain. \n This dance is meant to be a strong mold of what contempy moves and hip hop moves feel right to me in the songs, and should be challenging to anyone hopefully regardless of their level.',

There’s no storyline so it’s more free in terms of the structure of the piece. Every dancer will play a child in a broken home. The style will be a mixture of hip hop or contemp, but really it focuses more on the musicality of the song and how it feels to my body. \n Dancers interested can audition for either contemp or hip hop to be considered.',
